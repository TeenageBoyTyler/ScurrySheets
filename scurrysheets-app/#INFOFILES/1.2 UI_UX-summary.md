# scurrysheets UI/UX Guidelines for SvelteKit Implementation

## Design Philosophy

- **Extreme Minimalism**: Clean interfaces with minimal distractions
- **Fullscreen Focused Workflows**: Immersive experiences that maximize screen usage
- **Smooth Transitions**: Elegant movement between states provides context
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced features revealed only when needed
- **Dark Theme**: Modern aesthetic with reduced eye strain

## Color System

### Primary Colors

- **Primary**: #5f00ed - Main actions, focus states, and interactive elements
- **Background**: #121212 - Main application background
- **Surface**: #191919 - Cards, containers, and elevated elements 
- **Error/Warning**: #fa5656 - Error notifications and destructive actions

### Text Hierarchy

- **Primary Text**: White at 85% opacity - Headings and important content
- **Secondary Text**: White at 55% opacity - Supporting text and labels
- **Disabled Text**: White at 30% opacity - Inactive elements

### Tag Colors

Vibrant accent colors for categorization:
- Blue: #4285F4
- Green: #0F9D58
- Red: #DB4437
- Yellow: #F4B400
- Purple: #AB47BC
- Teal: #009688
- Orange: #FF5722
- Pink: #E91E63

## Interface Elements

### Typography

- **Headers**: "Coustard" - Bold, distinctive headings
- **Body**: "Abel" - Clean, readable text for all interface elements
- **Implementation**: Import fonts using SvelteKit's app.html or via TailwindCSS config

### Navigation Structure

The application uses a distinctive three-panel layout:

- **Three Equal Sections**: Upload, Search, and Profile form the main navigation
- **Expansion Behavior**: Active section expands while others contract
- **Inactive Panels**: Display vertical section title for easy access
- **Active Panel**: Shows full content with proper hierarchy
- **Implementation**: Use SvelteKit routing and layout files to define the panel structure

#### Desktop Layout
- Three horizontal panels
- Active panel takes ~80% of width
- Inactive panels become thin columns with vertical titles
- Implemented using SvelteKit's layout files and CSS Grid

#### Mobile Layout
- Three vertical panels
- Active panel takes ~80% of height
- Inactive panels become thin rows with horizontal titles
- Mobile layout defined using CSS media queries and SvelteKit layout variations

## Mobile vs Desktop Adaptations

### Mobile Optimizations
- Fullscreen focused interfaces
- Touch-friendly selection mechanisms
- Swipe gestures for navigation (implemented with svelte-gestures)
- Bottom action buttons for easy thumb access

### Desktop Enhancements
- Larger result grids with more columns
- Hover states for interactive elements
- Keyboard shortcuts (Shift+click for multi-select)
- Drag selection of multiple documents

### Component Appearance

#### Buttons

- **Primary Buttons**: Primary color with white text
  - Hover: Slight scale increase
  - Active: Scale down slightly
  - Implementation: Tailwind classes with Svelte transitions

- **Secondary Buttons**: Transparent with white border
  - Text brightens on hover

- **Text Buttons**: Primary color text
  - Subtle right movement on hover

- **Disabled State**: Reduced opacity, no hover effects

#### Input Fields

- **Base Style**: Borderless inputs on Surface color
  - Focus: Colored border appears
  - Error: Red border with subtle shake animation
  - Implementation: Combine TailwindCSS styles with Svelte animations

#### Tags/Chips

- **Style**: Pill-shaped with colorful backgrounds
- **Interactive Tags**: Scale up slightly on hover
- **Remove Icon**: "×" icon that rotates on hover

#### Cards/Containers

- **Style**: Surface color with rounded corners
- **Hover**: Subtle lift effect and shadow
- **Content**: Generous spacing around content

#### Loading States

- **Spinner**: Circular loading indicator in Primary color
- **Progress Bar**: Thin animated line showing progress
- **Skeleton Loading**: Placeholder shapes with pulse animation
- **SvelteKit-specific**: Use SvelteKit's built-in loading states for page transitions

### Animation Patterns

- **Panel Transitions**: 
  - Smooth expansion/contraction with content fade
  - Implementation: Use Svelte's built-in transition system

- **Page Transitions**:
  - Forward navigation: Slide from right to left
  - Backward navigation: Slide from left to right
  - Implementation: Use SvelteKit page transitions with Svelte's transition/animate directives

- **List Items**: 
  - Items appear with staggered timing
  - New items fade in with upward movement
  - Removed items fade out with downward movement
  - Implementation: Use Svelte's each block with transition:fly and stagger delays

- **Interactive Feedback**:
  - Elements respond immediately to user interaction
  - Subtle scale, brightness, or position changes
  - Error states include attention-drawing movement
  - Implementation: Combine CSS transitions with Svelte's reactive state for immediate visual feedback

## SvelteKit-Specific Implementation

```

### State Management

- Use Svelte stores for reactive state management:
  - Writable stores for local component state
  - Readable stores for derived state
  - Custom stores for complex state logic
  - Context API for global state sharing

### Form Handling

- Use SvelteKit's native form actions for server interactions
- Use Svelte's bind directives for two-way binding
- Form validation with client-side logic and server-side validation
- Reactive form updates with Svelte's reactive declarations

### TailwindCSS Integration

- Configure TailwindCSS with SvelteKit using postcss
- Define custom theme extending the base colors
- Create utility classes for common patterns
- Use @apply directive for component-specific styles

### Performance Considerations

- Use SvelteKit's built-in code splitting
- Leverage SvelteKit's server-side rendering (SSR)
- Implement preloading for anticipated routes
- Use Svelte's transition API for smooth animations
- Virtualize long lists for improved performance
